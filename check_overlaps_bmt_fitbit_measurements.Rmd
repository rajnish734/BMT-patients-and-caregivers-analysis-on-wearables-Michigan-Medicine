## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

We can plot the measurements for each of the participants with x axis being time, and see if there are overlaps between these participants. 

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
df_IDs <- read.csv("C:\\Users/rajnishk/Dropbox (University of Michigan)/Rajnish_data_group/BMT_fitbit_participants_pair.csv")


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
device_counts <- table(df_IDs$STUDY_PRTCPT_ID, useNA = "no")

```

```{r}
sorted_frequency <- sort(device_counts, decreasing = TRUE)
frequency_df <- as.data.frame(sorted_frequency)

# Name the columns accordingly
names(frequency_df) <- c("Value", "Frequency")

```

There are not always the pairs. 4UDRUW84 has 5 devices, but it's dyad has just one. So multiple devices don't necessarily come in pair. 

I am picking top 10 highest counts participants, and will download their heartrate and steps and see what it looks like.  

"CFI9I6K2", "PF1BLPH4", "4UDRUW84", "B51FUYGC", "FRSQKIQF", "U82WP671", "BNI9GAY5", "IUPUFELI", "M6WWDSQA", "SVIXFL83"

```{r}
top_values <- frequency_df$Value[1:10]

selected_participants_IDs <- df_IDs[df_IDs$STUDY_PRTCPT_ID %in% top_values, ]
```
This is a list of 150 fitbits. Reading the heart rate of these participants. 

```{r}
df_HR_top_10_prtcpt <- read.csv("C:\\Users/rajnishk/Dropbox (University of Michigan)/Rajnish_data_group/data paper BMT personal progress/top_10_particpants_with_multiple_fitibts_HR.csv")
```

convert both start and end times to POSIX so that I can do plotting on them.

```{r}
# Convert character date strings to POSIXct
df_HR_top_10_prtcpt$STUDY_METRIC_MSR_START_DT <- as.POSIXct(df_HR_top_10_prtcpt$STUDY_METRIC_MSR_START_DT, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz = "UTC")
df_HR_top_10_prtcpt$STUDY_METRIC_MSR_END_DT <- as.POSIXct(df_HR_top_10_prtcpt$STUDY_METRIC_MSR_END_DT, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz = "UTC")
```
Create columns for participant IDs in the HR dataframe 

```{r}
df_HR_top_10_prtcpt <- merge(
  x = df_HR_top_10_prtcpt,
  y = df_IDs[c("PRTCPT_DVC_ID", "STUDY_PRTCPT_ID")],
  by = "PRTCPT_DVC_ID",
  all.x = TRUE # Keep all records from df_HR_top_10_prtcpt
)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_HR_top_10_prtcpt, aes(x = STUDY_METRIC_MSR_START_DT, y = PRTCPT_DVC_ID)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +  # Add transparency with alpha
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Study Metric Measurement Start Date") +
  ylab("Participant Device ID") +
  ggtitle("Plot of Participant Device ID over Time") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = df_HR_top_10_prtcpt, aes(x = STUDY_METRIC_MSR_START_DT, y = PRTCPT_DVC_ID, color = STUDY_PRTCPT_ID)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Study Metric Measurement Start Date") +
  ylab("Participant Device ID") +
  ggtitle("Plot of Participant Device ID over Time by Study Participant ID") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_color_viridis_d()  # Optional: Use the viridis color palette for better color distinction
```
