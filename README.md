# BMT-patients-and-caregivers-analysis-on-wearables-Michigan-Medicine

This repository is a collection of various analysis, data cleaning and visualization etc. performed on data set from Bone Marrow Transplant patients and their caregivers at Michigan Medicine. I mainly used R and Python for this work. The data set comprised of physiological data coming from Fitbit devices along with the daily self reported mood score and their PROMIS score from survey.
