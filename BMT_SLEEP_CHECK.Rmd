## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
BMT_sleep <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\rajnishk\\OneDrive - Michigan Medicine\\Documents\\BMT_single_PRTCPT\\BMT_SLEEP_METRIC.csv")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
